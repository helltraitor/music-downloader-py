"""This module contains `IgnoredException`, `FileSystemConflict` and `FileSystem`.

The main class is a `FileSystem`. That class allows using os file system
safely, without afraid to harm file system (by bad naming). All names are
sanitized by `sanitize` function from `sanitizer` module.

Examples:
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>>
    >>> from downloader.filesystem import FileSystem, FileSystemConflict
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> home = FileSystem(FileSystemConflict.OVERRIDE, Path().home())
    >>>
    >>> async with home.into("Downloads") as downloads:
    >>>     async with downloads.open("test.txt").to_file() as file:
    >>>         await file.write(b"Music is cool")

class FileSystem:
    """`FileSystem` class is the more preferred way to interact with the os file system.

    This class allows to create folder with a filesystem in context. Further,
    that new instance can be used in child classes of expanded item (artist
    folder can be used as a root for album and so on in separated contexts).

    Also, this class allows controlling what happened when the same file
    (not folder) already exist. For example, on update this class allows
    to skip all existed tracks and add only new one.

    Examples:
        The same files can be ignored by catching a special exception: `IgnoredExcpetion`.
        That makes control flow to go upper from called code (it doesn't necessary
        to continue execution in a function that saves track when it already exists,
        so this only one way to return to outer code and continue work).
