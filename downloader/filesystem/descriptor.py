"""This module contains `Descriptor` class that allows to flexible work with tracks.

This class allows using async for both of entities types: files when track saving,
and track when it is editing. Also, this class saves all set id3 tags automatically.

Examples:
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>>
    >>> from mutagen import id3
    >>>
    >>> from downloader.filesystem import FileSystem, FileSystemConflict
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> home = FileSystem(FileSystemConflict.OVERRIDE, Path().home())
    >>>
    >>> async with home.into("Downloads") as downloads:
    >>>     async with downloads.open("track.mp3").to_track() as track:
    >>>         track.tags.add(id3.TIT2(encoding=3, text=["SomeTitle"]))

    This class allows using async for both of entities types: files when track
    saving, and track when it is editing.

    Warning:
        Both `to_file` and `to_track` provides context managers which
        ensure that file (or track) was saved properly. For track, it
        means that all tags will be saved after editing. And when no
        id3 tags are set, track files will be saved with en empty id3.
